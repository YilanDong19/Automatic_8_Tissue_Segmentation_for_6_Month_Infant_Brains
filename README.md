# Automatic 8 Tissue Segmentation for 6-Month Infant Brains
The GitHub repository for the paper "Automatic 8-Tissue Segmentation for 6-Month Infant Brains" is available here.

In this Paper, we propose the first 8-tissue segmentation pipeline for 6-month-old infant brains. The segmented tissues include WM, gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ventricles, cerebellum, basal ganglia, brainstem, and hippocampus/amygdala.

# Contribution
Our pipeline takes raw 6-month images as inputs and generates the 8-tissue segmentation as outputs, forming an end-to-end segmentation pipeline. Our evaluation with real 6-month images achieved a DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6 mm, and an ASSD of 0.42 mm.

# Introduction: 
To investigate the best solution for segmenting our target dataset (6-month data), we train and compare five different DL pipelines:

### 1. AUNet (baseline)

A MONAI Attention UNet [1] was trained on the neonatal T2w images and labels, then applied directly to real 6-month T2w images.

### 2. Cyc+AUNet

CycleGAN [2] was employed to transform neonatal T2w images into synthesized 6-month T2w images (neonatal images with 6-month intensity contrast). At the same time, an Attention UNet was trained on these synthesized 6-month images to predict their corresponding neonatal labels.

### 3. Cyc+AUNet+VM

Using the pre-trained Cyc+AUNet, we further employed VoxelMorph [3] to register synthesized 6-month T2w images to the real 6-month image space (paired), and keep training the Attention UNet on the warped synthesized 6-month images to predict warped neonatal labels.

### 4. Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT

First, we fed real 6-month T1w and T2w images into iBEAT to obtain the segmentation outputs. Second, we employed the same strategy as for Cyc+AUNet, but replaced the WM, GM and CSF segmentation outputs of Cyc+AUNet with iBEAT segmentation outputs.


### 5. Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT+AUNet

We trained a second Attention UNet on the real 6-month T1w and T2w images and their segmentation outputs from Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT.

The **Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT+AUNet** pipeline demonstrated the highest performance, achieving a DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6 ùëöùëö, and an ASSD of 0.42 ùëöùëö in 6-month brain segmentation. More comparison details can be found in our paper.


We uploaded the final segmentation models to the folder "Saved_segmentation_models"
